<h1 align="center"> Diffy Bot: Differential Equation Solver </h1>

<img src="docs/images/preview.png" class="center">

<p align="center"> <em> A powerful Telegram bot designed for solving differential equations using advanced numerical methods. </em> </p>

## Features

- **Equation Solving**  
  Capable of solving first-order and higher-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs).  
  The bot accepts user-defined equations and initial conditions, automatically parsing and preparing them for numerical analysis.

- **Numerical Methods**  
  Implements a range of well-established numerical methods to approximate solutions with varying degrees of accuracy and computational efficiency:
  - Euler's Method;
  - Midpoint Method;
  - Heun's Method;
  - Runge-Kutta Method;
  - Dormand-Prince Method.

- **Visualization**  
  Automatically generates clear and informative plots of the computed solutions.  
  These visualizations help users interpret the behavior of differential systems over time.

- **History Tracking**  
  Maintains a record of previously solved equations and their corresponding results, enabling users to revisit and review past computations.

- **Multilingual Support**  
  Offers interaction in multiple languages, enhancing accessibility and usability for users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

- **Customizable Settings**  
  Provides a flexible interface for tailoring computational and interaction parameters to user preferences:
  - **Numerical Method** – Choose from a list of supported methods (e.g., Euler, Runge-Kutta, Dormand-Prince).  
  - **Precision Control** – Set the number of decimal places to which numerical results are rounded.  
  - **Language Selection** – Choose the interface language for all commands and responses.  
  - **Hints Toggle** – Enable or disable contextual tips and usage hints to streamline the interface.
